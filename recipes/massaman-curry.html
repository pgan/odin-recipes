    <h2>What to expect</h2>
    <p>Massaman curry (Thai: แกงมัสมั่น, RTGS: kaeng matsaman, pronounced [kɛ̄ːŋ mát.sā.màn]) is a rich, flavourful, and mildly spicy Thai curry. It is a fusion dish, combining ingredients from three sources: Persia, the Indian Subcontinent, and the Malay Archipelago (e.g., cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, star anise, cumin, bay leaves, nutmeg, and mace) with ingredients more commonly used in native Thai cuisine (e.g., chili peppers, coriander, lemongrass, galangal, white pepper, shrimp paste, shallots, and garlic) to make massaman curry paste. The substance of the dish is usually based on chicken or other meat, potatoes, onions, and peanuts. The richness comes from the coconut milk and cream used as a base, as for many Thai curries.</p>
    <p>In 2011, CNNGo ranked massaman curry as the number one most delicious food in an article titled "World's 50 most delicious foods". However, by a readers’ survey, it ranked number ten. It remained at number one in the official, updated 2018 version.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>

        <li>4 tablespoons Thai red curry paste (such as Maesri Masaman Curry)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh ginger paste (such as Gourmet Garden)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemongrass paste (such as Gourmet Garden)</li>
        <li>2 (14 ounce) cans coconut milk, divided</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken stock, such as (Kitchen Basics)</li>
        <li>¼ cup peanut butter</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fish sauce, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup dry roasted peanuts, chopped, divided</li>
        <li>6 cups cooked jasmine rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step by Step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet. Add chicken pieces in batches, cooking until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Place browned chicken in the bottom of a slow cooker. Place potatoes, carrots, and bell peppers on top of the meat in the slow cooker.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in the skillet and add onion. Cook until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add to slow cooker. Add red curry paste, ginger paste, and lemongrass paste to the skillet and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in 1 can coconut milk; reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer until reduced by half, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk in remaining 1 can coconut milk, chicken broth, and peanut butter. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until liquid begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Pour sauce over ingredients in the slow cooker; stir gently to combine.</li>
        <li>Set slow cooker to Low and cook until vegetables are tender and chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 4 to 6 hours.</li>
        <li>20 minutes before serving season with lemon juice, fish sauce, and brown sugar. Stir in 1/2 cup of chopped peanuts. Serve with hot cooked rice and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup of peanuts.</li>
    </ol>
